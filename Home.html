<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>What is this shitty looking website?</p>
You are correct. This website is shitty looking, only because i probably wont update this to often. This website is probably the official site for : <a href="https://github.com/cOpEtriNe/RBLXFactBot">Visit The Project</a> | this website is for new users who need help configuring things with this bot script or just don't know how to use this script in general. If you know how to use exploits, as in, the basics like Executing, injecting and just basic functions like that. Then this guide or website is pretty much not really for you. Since you should pretty much know how to use and play with scripts on Roblox exploits.

<p>Where to get started.</p>
First of all if you came across this website in another game like TF2 or even Roblox (yes cOpEtriNe likes to advertise a lot of shit in TF2 since he plays it a lot) You should have gotten the script from : <a href="https://github.com/cOpEtriNe/RBLXFactBot">This github link.</a> | This is the official link for this script or bot. If you have paid for this script, You have been scammed. Demand your money back immediately! Now, once on the website you click on "Code" and then "Download ZIP" this basically just downloades all of the scripts needed for this bot. Once you have the ZIP extract it onto your desktop or somewhere on your computer so you know where it is. Next, pretty straight foward, Open up your favourite executor of choice, then open up any Roblox game. A great Roblox to test this in is : <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4483381587/VOICE-CHAT-a-literal-baseplate">Visit the game</a>| This is great since there is so many exploiters there is is Exploiterland pretty much. Now once you have the game opened and your exploit has been attached, you want to open the bot script folder here is where to find the script : find the folder you downloaded > RBLXFactBot-main > Bots > then script of choice. Now, instead of you using the script we will use AUTOMATICFactBot.lua | Or its probably a "file" format. now execute that into your game and it should automatically start working for you. You can check the console for credits :> Next time i edit this, it will be about the other scripts and what they do.
